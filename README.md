# N-Queens-Puzzle
The N-Queens Puzzle is a classic combinatorial problem in which the objective is to place  𝑁 N queens on an  𝑁 × 𝑁 N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can attack another queen if they are on the same row, column, or diagonal. The challenge is to arrange the queens such that none of these conditions are met.
